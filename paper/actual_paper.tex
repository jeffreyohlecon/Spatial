\section{Project Plan}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Idea Formation and Lit Review  Jan 13-17  [together ]
    \item Theory - Coming up with a Model/Try to meet with Esteban to get feedback? Jan 20-22 [together]
    \item Theory - Solving the Model Jan 23-24 [Key Person = Henrique]
    \item Coding (data, estimation, counterfactual, and results) - Jan 27 - Jan 31  [Key Person = ]
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Inputs are fairly divisible
        \item Outputs are less divisible
        \item Writing -  Feb 4 - 7  (KeyPerson)
   \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\section{Meeting Notes}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item  Could have teams of (2) for various things. 
    \item There are some tasks that are independent. 
    \item Decide to break stuff up once we actually have an idea.
    \item Henrique: Likes Lit Review / Idea Formation / Likes Writing [let us simplify model if possible]. Prefers the equilibrium part of coding to the early / data cleaning part Less good at Geodata.  Very good at polishing and visual details. 
    \item Jeffrey: Likes Coding / Likes Writing
    \item Yulia: Interested in counterfactuals part of coding. Curious about theory. Experience about writing / likes writing. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{ for next meeting, Jan 17 }
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Read model / counterfactuals of Monte et al in detail enough 
    \item In the Esteban choose your model 
    \item Map Monte et al to Esteban's choose your model. 
    \item Look at Jeffrey's ideas. 
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{During next meeting}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item pick idea
    \item assign data 
\end{enumerate}


\section{Introduction}
\textit{What is the question or policy you want to examine? Although we encourage
creativity, our main goal is to make you more familiar with quantitative spatial models
and give you some practice. If you have hard time coming up with an implementable
idea, you can choose from the following list of topics}


\textcolor{red}{paste in jeffrey's motivation from erh meeting}
We are going to examine the impact of the introduction of autonomous vehicles (AVs) on the spatial distribution of economic activity, and welfare.

While there is substantial uncertainty as to where AVs will be most adopted, and their costs, states are currently making decisions about how to regulate AVs (citation XYZ); this exercise will be useful to those deciding how to form regulations.




\section{Background and Diagnostic}
Prompt:Why is the question or policy you want to examine
important? Why is a quantitative spatial model the right tool to answer the question?
Are there any particular features of the policy/economic environment that are impor-
tant for the analysis? Feel free to focus on one or a few aspects that you want to study
in depth and identify the underlying mechanisms, which will inform you about the key
elements to be included in your model.



Once widely adopted, AVs simply represent a decline in commute costs.

But when we view AVs as not only a change in commute costs, but as a substitute for certain types of labor (e.g. taxi drivers, truck drivers),
 
\textcolor{red}{cost of housing near work or near home?}

The gain from substituting to AVs should be especially large where rents are high, since there are places where (i) wages must be high for low-skill workers, (ii) commuting  is relatively more attractive. 


We thus note this technology will have varied impacts (i) on low-skill and high-skill agents, and in (ii) areas where the cost of housing is relatively high vs. low.
This intuition is well-illustrated by the following 2x2 table:
\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
 & High Skill & Low Skill \\ \hline
High Rent & Unambig. Benefit from Declining Commute Costs &  \\ \hline
Low Rent & Unambig. Benefit from Declining Commute Costs &  \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Impact of AVs on different skill levels and places}
\label{tab:impact_avs}
\end{table}


The key question we hope to begin answering is \textbf{how varied benefits, across skill-levels and space, will determine the winners and losers of this technology}.

For now, we will capture this intuition in a reduced-form way, by
